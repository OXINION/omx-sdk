## 🚀 Next Steps to Publish

### Option A: Automated Publishing (Recommended)

1. **Set up npm token in GitHub secrets:**

   ```bash
   # Go to: GitHub repo → Settings → Secrets → Actions
   # Add secret: NPM_TOKEN with your npm token
   ```

2. **Create and merge version PR:**

   ```bash
   # The initial changeset is already created
   git add .
   git commit -m "chore: setup npm publishing"
   git push origin main

   # GitHub Actions will create a "Version Packages" PR
   # Review and merge it to trigger automatic publishing
   ```

### Option B: Manual Publishing

1. **Login to npm:**

   ```bash
   npm login
   ```

2. **Run the publish script:**

   ```bash
   ./scripts/publish.sh
   ```

   Or step by step:

   ```bash
   pnpm build
   pnpm changeset version  # Apply the changeset
   pnpm changeset publish  # Publish to npm
   ```
